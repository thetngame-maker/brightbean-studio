"""Publishing Engine - background worker logic (F-2.4).

This module implements the core publish loop:
1. Poll for PlatformPosts where scheduled_at <= now() and status = 'scheduled'.
2. Transition each due PlatformPost to 'publishing'.
3. Dispatch platform posts in parallel.
4. Handle retries with exponential backoff.
5. Post first comment after 2-minute delay.
6. Update per-platform status and log results.

Status is owned entirely by ``PlatformPost`` — the parent ``Post`` exposes an
aggregate ``status`` property derived from its children (see
``apps.composer.status``).
