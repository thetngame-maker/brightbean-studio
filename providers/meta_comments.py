"""Comment reading shared by the two Instagram providers.

Both Instagram connections read the same ``/{media-id}/comments`` edge and
differ only in host — Facebook Login goes through ``graph.facebook.com``,
Instagram Login through ``graph.instagram.com``. Everything else (field sets,
cutoff arithmetic, the own-comment filter, the reply-target rules) is identical,
so it lives here once rather than being copy-pasted into both modules.

``FacebookProvider`` keeps its own versions: its comments edge answers with
``message`` rather than ``text``, its post ids need page-scoping first, and it
reads a ``/feed`` edge rather than ``/media``.
